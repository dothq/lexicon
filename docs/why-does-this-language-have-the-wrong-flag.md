# Why does `x` language have the wrong flag?

![Language with wrong flag](https://i.imgur.com/d4xBoiZ.png)

We have not yet added all the flags to each language. 
We are slowly getting through each language, but it takes a lot of time.
The flag defaults to a üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è (skull and crossbones flag) emoji, hence why the flag is displaying as that. 

Since languages usually do not have a flag assosiated with them (for example, English could use the British flag, American flag, etc) it becomes difficult to figure out which flag to use. 
However, our rule of thumb is just to use the flag where the language originated or where it is most spoken. For example, English would use the British flag as that is where the language originated.

If you want to help us in adding the correct flag to your language, please consider opening a pull request. 
The language list is located at `frontend/util/flags.ts`.
